# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- `batchSubscribe` now joins socket rooms for all ACL-allowed IDs before entity resolution, matching `subscribe()`'s behavior. Previously, clients batch-subscribing to an ID that passed access checks but had no entity yet would not join the room and would miss future updates. This is a non-breaking behavioral fix — return values are unchanged (missing entities still return `null`), but sockets now correctly receive updates for entities created after subscription time.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- `useRoomEvents` hook for lifecycle-managed custom socket event listeners
  - Handles `socket.on`/`socket.off` cleanup automatically
  - Re-attaches listeners on reconnect
  - Handler functions stored in refs to avoid effect churn
  - Pair with `useSubscription` (room membership) for room-scoped events
- `invalidateOn` option for `useServiceQuery`
  - Listens for socket events and auto-refetches the query
  - Debounces rapid-fire events within 100ms
  - Ideal for keeping list queries in sync with real-time changes
- `UseRoomEventsOptions` type
- ESLint rule `no-raw-socket-on` — flags `socket.on()` in components, suggests `useRoomEvents`
- ESLint rule `no-raw-socket-emit` — flags `socket.emit()` in components, suggests `useService`/`useServiceQuery`
- Quickdraw ESLint plugin now included in `client` config with socket rules enabled as warnings

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- `useServiceQuery` hook for read operations with TanStack Query caching
  - Automatic request deduplication across components
  - Configurable `staleTime` and `gcTime` for cache management
  - `skipCache` option to force fresh fetch
  - `enabled` option for conditional fetching
  - Background refetching when data becomes stale
- `UseServiceQueryOptions` and `UseServiceQueryResult` types

### Fixed

- `useService` and `useServiceMethod` now return memoized objects to prevent infinite render loops when used in `useCallback`/`useEffect` dependencies
